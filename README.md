##  Questions
*1). Write a Python program to check whether a string is a palindrome or not using a stack.*

A palindromes are words, phrases, numbes, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

*2). Explain the concept of list comprehension in Python with at least three examples.*
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list. Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside.

**Example 1**
- Square Numbers
- Filtering Even Numbers
- String Transformation.

*3). Explain what a compound datatype is in Python with three examples.*

A compound datatype in python is a datatype that has capability to hold multiple values or elements of different types by only using a single name. The values are usually stored in an order whereby the compound datatype provides the order of which the values are accessed, modified or managed.

**Examples:**

**Lists**
Python lists are used to store elements of text inside a square bracket separated by commas. List contains characteristics namely;
- Lists are mutable and dynamic;
- List items can be added, removed or changed after the list is defined. 
- Lists are ordered; newly added items will be placed at the end of the list. 
- Lists use zero-based indexing; every list item has an associated index, and the first item's index is 0.

**Tuples**
Python tuples are a type of data structure that is very similar to lists. The main difference between the two is that tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created. This makes them ideal for storing data that should not be modified, such as database records.

**Dictionary**

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
